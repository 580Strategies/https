### Standards and tools

[SSL Labs](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/) is a universally referenced HTTPS evaluation and grading tool for public-facing websites.

18F has also written [`https-scan`](https://github.com/18F/https-scan), a command line tool which runs one or more domains through several separate small tools:

* [`ssllabs-scan`](https://github.com/ssllabs/ssllabs-scan) - Command line tool for the SSL Labs API. (See its [Terms of Use](https://github.com/ssllabs/ssllabs-scan/blob/master/ssllabs-api-docs.md#terms-and-conditions).)
* [`mixed-content-scan`](https://github.com/bramus/mixed-content-scan) - Command line tool for walking over a website and scanning for the use of insecure resources.
* [`site-inspector`](https://github.com/benbalter/site-inspector-ruby) - Scan a domain for various web/HTTP-related properties, including HTTPS support.
