### Internet standards movement

* The W3C's Technical Architecture Group has found that [the web should actively prefer secure connections](https://w3ctag.github.io/web-https/) and transition entirely to HTTPS.
* The IETF has said that [pervasive monitoring is an attack](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc7258/), and the Internet Architecture Board (the IETF's parent organization) recommends that [new protocols use encryption by default](http://www.internetsociety.org/news/internet-society-commends-internet-architecture-board-recommendation-encryption-default).

### Industry movement

* Google [gives a search ranking boost](http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2014/08/https-as-ranking-signal.html)  to HTTPS sites.
* Chrome plans to [mark HTTP as non-secure](https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/marking-http-as-non-secure).
* Chrome also plans to [restrict some features to HTTPS sites](https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/forum/#!topic/blink-dev/2LXKVWYkOus), including geolocation.

### Standards and tools

[SSL Labs](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/) is a universally referenced HTTPS evaluation and grading tool.

18F has also written [`https-scan`](https://github.com/18F/https-scan), a command line tool which runs one or more domains through several separate small tools:

* [`ssllabs-scan`](https://github.com/ssllabs/ssllabs-scan) - Command line tool for the SSL Labs API. (See its [Terms of Use](https://github.com/ssllabs/ssllabs-scan/blob/master/ssllabs-api-docs.md#terms-and-conditions).)
* [`mixed-content-scan`](https://github.com/bramus/mixed-content-scan) - Command line tool for walking over a website and scanning for the use of insecure resources.
* [`site-inspector`](https://github.com/benbalter/site-inspector-ruby) - Scan a domain for various web/HTTP-related properties, including HTTPS support.
