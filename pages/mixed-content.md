### What is mixed content?

When you view a page in your browser, it is almost never just a single request. Almost every web page contains resources, such as Javascript, CSS, and images, which cause additional requests. Sometimes these requests are to the same servers as the rest of the site, other times they are external resources (such as Google Analytics Javascript snippets).

When the main page is loaded over `HTTPS` and these sub-resources are loaded over `HTTP` this is called mixed content. Mixed content comes in two varieties active mixed content, which refers to Javascript and CSS resources, and passive mixed content, which refers to images.

When browsers encounter active mixed content they will block it, this often results in affected pages being completely unstyled. When they encounter passive mixed content, they will load the resource, but change the HTTPS indicator. In Chrome this means that the "green lock" icon becomes a gray lock with a yellow triangle over it.

### Why is mixed content a problem?

Mixed content is a problem because, were browsers to allow it, an attacker would be able to conduct a MITM attack against it the same way they could the main page. Even where browsers do allow it, as with images, attackers can manipulate what the page looks like, and the yellow-lock icon reduces user confidence. In addition, an attacker will be able to read any cookies for that domain which do have the `Secure` flag, and set cookies.

Because when a website is `HTTP`-only loading other `HTTP` sub-resources does not generate any sort of warning, websites often accumulate lots of these sub-resources. When a website tries to migrate to being available over `HTTPS` these can often become a source of difficulty.

### Strategies for dealing with mixed content

The easiest approaches are to use relative URLS (e.g. `<img src="/media/my-picture.png" />`) or protocol-relative URLs (e.g. `<img src="//other-website.com/their-picture.png" />`). These will work with both `HTTP` and `HTTPS` websites. `https://` can also be safely used from both `HTTP` and `HTTPS` pages (however these are often more difficult for local development).

In order to locate mixed content, the easiest way to start is to load your website in a browser over `https://` and see if it looks ok. Both Chrome and Firefox will log any mixed content to the console. This gives a quick way to get a sense of how large the problem is.

Another approach is to grep your codebase for any explicit `http://` URLs, since these will always cause a problem.

Finally, [Mixed Content Scan](https://github.com/bramus/mixed-content-scan) can be used to scan a website to see if it contains any mixed content.
