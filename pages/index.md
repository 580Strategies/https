Government web services should provide reliable content and be protected from impersonation. Users should feel confident that their interactions with government web services are handled in a private manner.

**HTTPS** (`https://`) provides a private encrypted connection across the public internet, and ensures that information has not been modified in transit.

Plain HTTP (`http://`) connections are insecure, and allow an attacker to easily intercept traffic, track users, or impersonate the government.

In today's internet, and today's browsers, HTTPS is an important baseline for _all_ government websites, no matter how small or how sensitive.
