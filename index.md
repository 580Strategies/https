HTTPS (`https://`) provides a secure, private connection across the public internet. Plain HTTP (`http://`) connections are insecure, and can be easily intercepted, manipulated, and impersonated.

In today's internet, and today's browsers, HTTPS is a helpful baseline for _all_ government websites, no matter how small or how sensitive.

Read [the FAQ](/faq/) for more commonly asked questions.

### Why HTTPS for everything?

HTTPS makes sense for all websites, even smaller or more "non-sensitive" websites.

As encrypted traffic becomes more widespread and more normal, web browsers and other clients can begin assuming HTTPS with more confidence. This means more new web functionality can require HTTPS to function, and that browsers can reduce the likelihood of phishing and user error by making failure modes more strict.

In other words, **protecting non-sensitive sites strengthens the protections of sensitive sites**, by allowing browsers and clients to offer much stronger guarantees and warnings when those protections break down.

Additionally, a policy of always using HTTPS means not having to engineer a boundary around "sensitive" parts of the application, or to judge where those lines should be drawn. This reduces room for error, and simplifies technical deployment.

Finally, unencrypted traffic is subject to blanket monitoring and tracking across all websites a user visits, without user consent. These kinds of attacks are commonplace today across the world, and bring into question whether there is such a thing as "non-sensitive" traffic. These attacks are defeated by HTTPS, and so fare made infeasible by increasing the overall rate of encrypted traffic.

### HTTPS is the internet's next phase

Over the last several years, the internet's standards bodies, web browsers, major tech companies, and the internet community of practice have all come to understand that HTTPS should be the baseline for all web traffic.

* The W3C's Technical Architecture Group has found that [the web should actively prefer secure connections](https://w3ctag.github.io/web-https/) and transition entirely to HTTPS.
* The IETF has said that [pervasive monitoring is an attack](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc7258/), and the Internet Architecture Board (the IETF's parent organization) recommends that [new protocols use encryption by default](http://www.internetsociety.org/news/internet-society-commends-internet-architecture-board-recommendation-encryption-default).
* Google [favors HTTPS websites in search rankings](http://googleonlinesecurity.blogspot.com/2014/08/https-as-ranking-signal_6.html), and the Chrome security team is working on [gradually marking plain HTTP as non-secure](https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/marking-http-as-non-secure).

Ultimately, the internet's goal is to establish encryption as the norm, and to phase out unencrypted connections.

Investing in HTTPS makes it faster, cheaper, and easier for everyone. Many of the advancements of the last several years have come from major institutions and technology companies committing to migrate, improving the status quo, and contributing their improvements back to the public.

The more US government websites and services that join the transition to an encrypted internet, the smoother and faster it will be.
